TL;DR

pick up certificate

For everything to work and not only your browser, you need to add that CA certificate to the system's trusted CA repository.

In ubuntu:

    Go to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
    Create a new folder, i.e. "sudo mkdir school"
    Copy the .crt file into the school folder
    Make sure the permissions are OK (755 for the folder, 644 for the file)
    Run "sudo update-ca-certificates"
