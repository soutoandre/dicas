xecution.isolation.semaphore.maxConcurrentRequests

This property sets the maximum number of requests allowed to a HystrixCommand.run() method when you are using ExecutionIsolationStrategy.SEMAPHORE.

If this maximum concurrent limit is hit then subsequent requests will be rejected.

The logic that you use when you size a semaphore is basically the same as when you choose how many threads to add to a thread-pool, but the overhead for a semaphore is far smaller and typically the executions are far faster (sub-millisecond), otherwise you would be using threads.

    For example, 5000rps on a single instance for in-memory lookups with metrics being gathered has been seen to work with a semaphore of only 2.

The isolation principle is still the same so the semaphore should still be a small percentage of the overall container (i.e. Tomcat) thread pool, not all of or most of it, otherwise it provides no protection.
